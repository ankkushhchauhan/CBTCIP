# Unemployment Analysis using Python

This project analyzes the unemployment scenario before and after the lockdown using Python, focusing on data analysis, visualizations, and insights from the provided dataset.

## Features

- Analyze unemployment rates, employment, and labor participation across different states and regions.
- Visualize unemployment rates with various plots and charts.
- Compare average unemployment rates before and after the lockdown.
- Explore the impact of the lockdown on employment in different states.
- Deploy the analysis as a web application using Streamlit for an enhanced user interface.

## Dataset

The dataset, **`data.csv`**, contains information on unemployment rates, employment, labor participation, and other relevant factors for different states and regions.

## Code

- `unemployment-analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- `app.py`: Streamlit code for deploying the project as a web application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for running the Streamlit app.

## Deployed Application

The project is deployed as a web application using Streamlit. Access the deployed application [here](https://unemployment-analysis-shrudex.streamlit.app/).

## Project Structure

## Additional Notes

This project, part of a data science internship at **Oasis Infobyte**, includes an in-depth analysis of unemployment rates using Python. Various visualizations, such as descriptive statistics, heatmaps, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and geographical plots, were used to understand trends and patterns in the unemployment data. The project is also deployed as a Streamlit web application for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Refer to the Jupyter Notebook file (_unemployment-analysis.ipynb_) for a detailed step-by-step analysis and visualization code.
